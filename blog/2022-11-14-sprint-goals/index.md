## Sprint Planning

In these sprint the group will focus on these two User Stories:

* As Alexandre, I want to be responsible for adding the cameras and sensors that were installed into the system so that a new client that wants to protect his new business can be satisfied. (2 points)

* As Teresa, I want to login in my account, so that I can access my dashboard (2 points)

* As Teresa, I want to store CCTV footage of the intrusion, so that I can use that information as legal proof the moment I make a complaint to the police. (2 points) 

* As Teresa, I want the light and sound alarms to be automatically triggered, if an intrusion is detected, so that I can keep my business safe and avoid robberies. (2 points)

In the fourth sprint we were expecting to complete the following user story from the previous sprint: "As Teresa, I want to be notified when an intrusion occurs in my business, so that I can allow myself to be more comfortable and feel safe about my investment." 

To do so we need to have this Sprint Goals:

* IDP Login 
* Add properties, cameras, sensors on the dashboard Client and Manager UI
* Trigger these equipments in case of intrusion
* Deploy Microservices

Story Points Estimated: 8
