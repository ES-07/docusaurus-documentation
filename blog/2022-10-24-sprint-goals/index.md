## Sprint Planning


In the third sprint we were expecting to achieve these goals:

- User story 1: As Teresa, I want to login in my account, so that I can access my dashboard; (3 points)
- User story 2: "As Teresa, I want to be notified when an intrusion occurs in my business, so that I can allow myself to be more comfortable and feel safe about my investment." (5 points)
- Focus more on the client side and backend;
- Communication flow between Camera API, Intrusion API and HDM;
- Client UI with access to create and login account (without IDP yet), check his intrusions and profile page.

Story Points Estimated: 8



## Sprint Review

Stakeholders appreciated that we were delivering user stories, however we need to be more efficient.

Story Points Delivered: 3


## Sprint Retrospective 

 - What went well? Client side pretty much developed.

- What could be improved? Even the work in the team.

- What went badly? Nothing serious.
