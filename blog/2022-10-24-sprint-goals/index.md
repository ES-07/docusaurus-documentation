In the third sprint we were expecting to complete the following user story:
**Notify business' owner when an intrusion occurs**. To complete it, we had to fulfill the following requirements:
* Finish API Sites Management
* Store Intrusions in DataBase, when **HDM** detects it
* Intrusion API communicate with Notifications API, through API Gateway
* Intrusion API asks for video frames to camera API and this module answers through rabbit mq
* Intrusion API joins the received frames in a video and send it to AWS S3.


In spite of, not all objectives were achieved, we considered that this was a positive sprint, once we fulfill the most priority ones.
