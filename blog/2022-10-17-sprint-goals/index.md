In our second week of development, we had the following goals:
* Develop client's frontend
* Build Site's Management API
* Connect the two modules in order to present information to client, such as, their properties, the intrusion's history and the devices present in their properties.

Although, **frontend** was developed **successfully**, unfortunelly backend module wasn't. Our modelation suffered some changes during the sprint, and we had to modelate our backend module several times.
