# Sprint 0

From: 10/10/2022
To: 17/10/2022


## Sprint Planning


In order to complete our first sprint, it is expectable to conclude the following sprint goals:

- Configurate the GitHub organization and define the Git Workflow.
- Create User Stories, Personas
- Produce a functional frontend prototype for the sites management API with some working features.
- Define, document and test the most important endpoints of the intrusion management API.
- Implement the database for the sites management API.
- Implement CI/CD for at least one of the system modules.

Story Points: 0 

## Sprint Review

After the sprint review, the stakeholders advise us to take "baby steps". Our goals were too general and difficult, we should focus on the user stories. Work in a vertically way, which means, every member of the team is focused on that goal and work in all the modules (Backend, Frontend, Testing, DevOps) to delivery the stories. 


## Sprint Respective

 - What went well? We have all now to start working (user stories prioritezed, documentation, frontend prototype and the Sites Management API)

- What could be improved? Less bigger goals.

- What went badly? For the next sprint we will try to go more focused in something smaller.
