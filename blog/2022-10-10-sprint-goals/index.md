## Sprint Planning


In order to start our project, it is expectable to conclude the following sprint goals:

- Configure the GitHub organization and define the Git Workflow.
- Create User Stories, Personas
- Produce a functional frontend prototype for the sites management API with some working features.
- Define, document and test the most important endpoints of the intrusion management API.
- Implement the database for the sites management API.
- Implement CI/CD for at least one of the system modules.



Story Points: 0 

## Sprint Review

After the sprint review, the stakeholders advise us to take "baby steps". Our goals were too general and difficult, we should focus on the user stories. Work in a vertical way, which means, every member of the team is focused on that goal and work in all the modules (Backend, Frontend, Testing, DevOps) to deliver user stories. 3 of the goals were accomplished.


## Sprint Retrospective 

 - What went well? We have all now to start working (user stories prioritized, documentation, frontend prototype and the Sites Management API)

- What could be improved? Less big goals.

- What went badly? For the next sprint, we will try to go more focused in something smaller.
