The Frontend of the Client side was developed to be simple and intuitive to the user. 
It has several pages:
(por imgs)

### Login/Sign in Page

The user can login or sign in. If he doesn't have an account, he can click on the "Sign in" button and then he will be redirected to the sign in page.

### Properties page

The client can see the list of properties that he owns.If he clicks on one of them, he will be redirected to the property page, where he was information about the property, the devices and the intrusions that occurred in the property.  

He can see what devices are in the property, what type they are, change their state (or see).



### Intrusion page

Here is reunited all of the intrusions that occurred to all his properties. A intrusion is characterized by the timestamp, the device that was triggered and of course, what property did it occurred. It is also possible to download them. This table has the same filtering/sorting characteristic that the client page has. 

### Profile page

The client can see his personal information and change some of them, for example his cellphone number or his address. In future work it will be possible to change the notification type.
