# Actors

In the context of user stories, an actor is the person that performs the actions described in the user story. The actor is typically referred to as "a [type of user]" in the user story format, and is identified to help clarify who the user story is intended for and what actions they will be able to perform. This can help teams to better understand the requirements of the user story. To use the CCTV Systems, we identify two main actors:

* **Clients**: Clients will check their properties with our security system, the devices (cameras, alarms), receive intrusion notifications if anything occurs. Also, these people can access the list of all events triggered in their building.


* **Managers**: Managers will manage the cameras and alarms installed on-premises and as well as all their clients and monitored buildings.
