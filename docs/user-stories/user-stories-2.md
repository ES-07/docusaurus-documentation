# Definition of done

In the context of agile software development, "Definition of Done" (also known as  **DoD** ) is a set of criterias that must be met in order for a product increment (such as a user story or a feature) to be considered complete and ready for release. Therefore, the team is sure that is delivering high-quality software. 
The team agreed that the plan for our DoD in the beginning was: 

1. Unit tests passed;
2. Code reviewed by peers and merged into the "developed" branch;
3. Product owner accepts the user story.

However with the lack of time, the list reduced to only item number 2 and 3, leaving the quality-assurance behind.
