# Story Points

Story points are a unit of measure used in agile software development to estimate the size or complexity of a user story or other product increment. They help to plan and prioritize the amount of work that is need to be done to a specific story, and to provide a common language for discussing and comparing the size and complexity of different stories. The story points for our user stories were assigned in a group meeting, where each of us said our opinion regarding how many points a user story should have, then we did the average of each one and attributed the pontuation. To attribute points to our stories, we inspire us in the following table that uses the *Fibonacci Sequence*.



| How much is known about the task | Dependencies | How much work effort | Story points |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Everything | None | Less than 2 hours | 1 |
| Almost everything | Almost none | Half a day | 2 |
| Something | Some | Up to 2 days | 3 |
| Almost nothing | Few | Few days | 5 |
| Nothing | More than a few | Around a week | 8 (should be split into smaller items) |
| Nothing | Unknown | More than one week | 13 (must be split into smaller items) |
