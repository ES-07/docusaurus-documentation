# Story Points

| How much is known about the task | Everything | Almost everything | Something | Almost nothing | Nothing | Nothing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dependencies | None | Almost none | Some | Few | More than few | Unknown |
| How much work effort | Less than 2 hours | Half a day | Up to two days | Few days | Around a week | More than one week |
