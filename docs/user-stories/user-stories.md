# User Stories

The user stories are one of the most important things on a project.

We define some of them and prioritezed them in a scale of 1 to 3 (from the most priority to the less priority):

* As Alexandre, I want to store CCTV footage of the intrusion, so that I can use that information as legal proof and serve it to the client.  (1)
* As Teresa, I want to be notified when an intrusion occurs in my business, so that I can allow myself to be more comfortable and feel safe about my investment. (1)

* As Alexandre, I receive a new request from a new client that wants to protect his new business so I’m responsible for adding the cameras and sensors that were installed into the system.  (2)
* As Alexandre, I want to use a platform with a trustful authentication mechanism, so that all the CCTV footage is available only for specific personnel and well protected from hackers or impersonators. (2)
* As Teresa, I want to store CCTV footage of the intrusion, so that I can use that information as legal proof the moment I make a complaint to the police. (2)
* As Teresa, I want the light and sound alarms to be automatically triggered, if an intrusion is detected, so that I can keep my business safe and avoid robberies. (2)

* As Alexandre, I want to know my clients information, so that I can be in contact with them whenever I need. (3)
* As Alexandre, I want to check the system logs, so that I can visualize information on every event received from the cameras and its metadata. (3)
* As Alexandre, I want to check the metrics from all the CCTV equipment, so that I can have a global vision on how each hardware is performing. (3)
* As Alexandre, I receive a request from a client, Teresa, that wants to add one more security camera and sensor in a window. I want to add the new camera and sensor into the system. (3)
* As  Teresa, I want to receive voice calls and text messages while I’m being notified of an intrusion, so that I can be immediately warned. (3)


Of course, some of them are a bit complex, so in the sprints they will be split in smaller ones.
